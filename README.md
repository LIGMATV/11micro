## What is this?

It's like Linktree, you can add links and small notes but in specified quantities and customizations. The design is really inspired by Gravatar and Omg.lol. It's not have an really big button for each link, instead it's look like an neatly arranged list with icons.

## Configuration

All the configuration you needed to edit is just the [`_data/index.yaml`](_data/index.yaml).  
**But why use YAML and don't use JSON under hood?** It's make anyone easier to understanding on add data, also YAML supporting multiline code which is used in Notes. The code is neatly arranged and not confusing, without a GUI, almost anyone can understand a code layout like this.  
To make this YAML data works, we using `js-yaml` package.

You may see an comments in that file like `# Site configuration` or `# Notes (Markdown supported!)`. You can learn from that and starting to edit your datas.
